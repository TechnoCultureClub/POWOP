Title: What if I don’t win?

----

Text: Money isn’t everything. Every step you take to making your project happen is a small win worth celebrating. You’ll get feedback from submitting your project even if you don’t get to present, as well as meeting new potential collaborators when you come to the event. You’ll get to practice pitching your project, get a room full of applause, and perhaps inspire people to help you out even if you don’t win the cash.
